Converting SASS to CSS fieldset

ALL DONE IN TERMINAL
1) created a SCSS files
2) installed NPM
3) installed SASS
4) installed bootstrap
5) installed browser-sync
6) typed "sass main.scss output.css" which takes the original SCSS file that I
created and makes a new CSS file.
7) then I typed the above command but added --watch to it so it will update to
my file and I can see changes as they happen.
